This is a comprehensive and well-defined plan for a powerful local AI application. The architecture requires a layered approach to handle the diverse data types and advanced LLM features.

Given your use of **Electron, Vite, and React/JS** for a full-stack, offline desktop application, here is the suggested structure for your advanced system.

## 1. Core System Architecture & Data Flow

| Component | Responsibility | Technology/Concept |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend/App** | User Interface (UI), Input/Output handling, Settings. | **React/Vite/Electron** |
| **Local LLM Engine** | Runs the quantized LLM(s) offline. | **Ollama** or **llama.cpp (GGUF)** wrapper |
| **Data Ingestion Agent** | File parsing, type detection, chunking. | **Node.js/JS Libraries** (e.g., `pdfjs`, `unstructured` wrappers) |
| **Vector Database** | Stores text and image embeddings for RAG. | **Local DB** (e.g., **ChromaDB, LanceDB, or FAISS** running locally) |
| **Multimodal Encoder** | Generates embeddings for text/images. | **Quantized Embedding Model (e.g., CLIP variant)** |
| **RAG/Agentic Orchestrator** | Manages multi-step tasks, memory, and tool-calling (via MCP structure). | **Custom JS/Node.js Logic (LangChainJS structure)** |

## 2. Advanced Pages, Sections, and Subsections

Your application should be organized around the user's workflow: managing models, managing data, and interacting with the AI.

### üìÑ Pages (Primary Views)

| Page | Purpose | Key Functionality |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Agent Workspace (Home)** | Primary interaction interface for queries. | Chat UI, Multi-turn conversation, File/Image upload. |
| **2. Knowledge Base Manager (RAG)** | Central control for all local data/knowledge. | Data ingestion, Vector Store management, Context configuration. |
| **3. Model & Engine Control** | Management of LLM binaries, quantization, and device settings. | Model downloads, Active Model selection, Health checks. |
| **4. Learning & Feedback Loop** | Interface for reviewing and applying corrections/rewards (for DPO/RLHF). | Interaction history, Feedback logging, Re-training scheduling. |

### üß≠ Sections & Sub-sections (Within Pages)

#### 1. Agent Workspace (Core Interaction)
* **Section: Chat Interface**
    * *Sub-section: Input Zone:* Multi-line text input, Drag-and-drop file/image area.
    * *Sub-section: Output Display:* Advanced markdown rendering, **Dynamic JSON Viewer** (to display structured output as a table, form, or chart).
* **Section: Active Context Panel**
    * *Sub-section: **Memory Binding Toggle (Layer 1)**:* On/Off switch for using recent conversation history.
    * *Sub-section: **RAG Context Toggle (Layer 2)**:* On/Off switch for grounding the answer to the loaded knowledge base.
    * *Sub-section: **File Insight**:* Displays detected file types and initial extraction status for uploaded files.

#### 2. Knowledge Base Manager (RAG Control)
* **Section: Data Sources Ingestion**
    * *Sub-section: **File Uploader**:* Bulk upload for all supported formats (PDF, DOCS, IMG, CSV, etc.).
    * *Sub-section: **Ingestion Queue**:* Status of files being parsed, chunked, and embedded.
* **Section: Vector Store Configuration**
    * *Sub-section: **Chunking Strategy**:* Settings for chunk size (text) and embedding type (text/image).
    * *Sub-section: **Active Knowledge Sets**:* Ability to create separate, queryable knowledge partitions (e.g., "HR Manuals," "Project Images").

#### 3. Model & Engine Control (Technical Settings)
* **Section: LLM Management**
    * *Sub-section: **Model Library**:* List of available local GGUF/quantized models (e.g., LLaVA-7B-Q4, Mistral-7B-Q8).
    * *Sub-section: **Multi-Model Routing**:* Logic/rules editor for how the orchestrator decides *which model* to use for a specific file type or task (e.g., "If input is an image, use MLLM; otherwise, use NLP LLM").
* **Section: Core Engine Settings**
    * *Sub-section: **Hardware Allocation**:* Sliders/inputs for **GPU/CPU VRAM** allocation, Thread count.
    * *Sub-section: **Quantization & Format**:* Display model quantization level (e.g., 4-bit, 8-bit).

## 3. Setting Criteria (Crucial for an Advanced System)

### ‚öôÔ∏è System & Model Criteria
1.  **Offline Core:** All critical functions (Inference, RAG Retrieval, Embedding) must be functional without an internet connection.
2.  **Multimodal Orchestration:** The RAG component must handle **separate/fused vector embeddings** for text and images, allowing a single text query to retrieve relevant chunks *and* images.
3.  **Dynamic JSON Output:** LLM must be consistently prompted (e.g., using **JSON Schema**) to output a dynamic JSON object that the React frontend can interpret and render as tables, lists, or custom components.
4.  **File Type Auto-Detection:** The **Data Ingestion Agent** must accurately identify the mime-type/extension of uploaded files to select the correct parser and pre-processing step (e.g., using an MLLM for image descriptions before RAG).

### üß† RAG & Memory Criteria
* **Dual-Layered RAG:**
    * **Layer 1 (Short-Term Memory):** Conversation History Buffer (simple context window in the prompt).
    * **Layer 2 (Long-Term RAG):** Context retrieved from the local Vector Database.
* **Reward/Punishment Loop:** Criteria for collecting and logging user feedback (e.g., "Good Answer üëç / Bad Answer üëé") to generate the preference dataset for future DPO/RLHF fine-tuning.

### üåê Interoperability Criteria
* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Structure:** The internal tool-calling mechanism (how the LLM calls the RAG system or data extractor) should follow the conceptual client-server structure of the MCP to remain extensible for future external services.

This design gives your Electron application a robust architecture for a private, offline AI agent that can handle complex data and sophisticated tasks.

The following video discusses how to run a local RAG system with tools like LM Studio and AnythingLLM, which are relevant to your offline, data-driven approach. [Building a Local RAG System with LM Studio and AnythingLLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFLHmlG5FIE)
